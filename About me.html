        I am a motivated and adaptable individual with a passion for both personal and 
        professional growth. My interests range from playing golf, which has taught me patience, 
        discipline, and a strategic mindset, to puzzle-solving and video games, which reflect my 
        problem-solving skills and creativity. I also value social connections, and I enjoy 
        spending time with friends, which has helped me develop strong communication and 
        teamwork abilities. <br><br>
        I strive to bring these qualities—discipline, problem-solving, teamwork, and adaptability—
        into everything I do, whether it is in my studies, future career in software engineering, 
        or my personal interests.

        Through my previous work experiences, I have gained valuable skills that I continue 
        to carry forward. As a Shop Assistant, I learned how to deliver excellent customer 
        service and operate efficiently in a fast-paced environment. Working as a Courier gave 
        me experience with responsibility, time management, and working independently during 
        demanding night shifts. My role as a Paver/Worker required persistence, physical 
        endurance, and attention to detail, while my experience as a Carer strengthened my 
        empathy, reliability, and ability to handle challenging situations with professionalism.
